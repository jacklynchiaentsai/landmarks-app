# landmarks-ios-app
Studying abroad in NYC, I have always wanted to create an app that allows me to share, plan, and revisit the places I've been to / wanted to visit.   
This is my first iOS app, featuring the NYC landmarks I've been to / wanted to visit. Also allows users to mark their favorite landmarks.   
Run app through Xcode simulator or local iOS device
