 - lists work with identifiable data
 1) passing along with data a key path to a property that uniquely identifies each element
 2) conform data type to Identifiable protocol
 - set navigation capacbilities to a list by embedding it in a NavifationView, and then nesting each row in a NavigationLink
 - when the elements of array are simple value types use \.self as key path to the identifier
 - state is a value or a set of values that affect's a view's behavior
 - use a property with @State attribute to add state to a view
 - binding acts as a reference to a mutable state
 - to combine static and dynamic views in a list or to combine two or more different groups of dynamic groups use foreach instead of passing to list
 - use $ prefix to access a binding to a state variable or one of its properties
 - both the detail and list view access the same model object in the environment so the two views maintain consistency
